// SO basically we can run javascript inside our browsers only as browsers have javascript engine which enable to run js
//but to run js outide the browser is not possible
//so ryan dahl made the thing which is he cobmbined Chrome V8 engine with c++
//due to whcih no wit is possible to run js outisise th ebwosers as well
//and this whole cobination of v8+c++ is known as Node js
//so Node js is nothing but the js runtime environment...it means it the is environment in which you can run your javascript
//like if we write console.log() in our inspect of our browsers it will usrely run ,but it does not run when we will run the 
//same code on our terminal withi=out node js so to do so
//install node js globally on your machine and on treminal initialize it by simply writing node/
//then you can simply write whatever you want  to run as same as consoole
